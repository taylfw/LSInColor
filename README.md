# LSInColor

lsInColor.py is being developed to help the understanding of the linux file/permission structure.

Each element of the file is assigned to a color to make it more readable for humans. 

To make this tool useful globally, do the following 2 commands as root:

```bash
chmod +x lsInColor.py
```
Then copy it to your /usr/local/bin directory:

```bash
cp lsInColor.py /usr/local/bin
```
You should be able to execute lsInColor.py from any directory

## Example Output:
![lsInColor](https://github.com/taylfw/LSInColor/blob/main/img/OutPut.png?raw=true)
